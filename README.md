# Multiple_LED_Blink
This project demonstrates LED pattern generation using the LPC2129 (ARM7) microcontroller, programmed in Embedded C using Keil µVision IDE. Eight LEDs connected to Port 0 are controlled to display right shift, left shift, and convergence–divergence patterns. A precise delay is generated using Timer0, ensuring accurate timing for LED transitions. The project includes a Proteus simulation to verify functionality without physical hardware and helps in understanding GPIO control and timer-based delays in ARM7 microcontrollers.
